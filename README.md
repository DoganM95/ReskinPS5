## I don't like the labels - How do I remove them?
You can delete the labels in the theme installation folder under ***\Icons\Labels***

To open the theme installation folder go to:
*Add-ons (F9) > Installed > Themes Fullscreen > Reskin PS5 > Installation Folder*

## I don't see an icon or label that I want?
You have two options:

1. You can create an icon and place it in ***\Icons\Filters*** for Icons or ***\Icons\Labels*** or Platform labels in the theme folder
- However you will need to backup your icons as every time the theme is updated it will overwrite the icons in that folder

2. You can raise a request for a new icon/platform/logo **[here](https://github.com/TheKersalMassive/ReskinPS5/issues)**
- Create a **New Issue** and/or attach your icon if you want it added to the theme. Each icon submission will be reviewed and needs to match the general scheme and aesthtic of the theme

## How do I get a custom colour border?

Note: Custom border colours only work if you have one single tag assigned to a game

1. In Desktop Mode, right click on your game(s) and click on ***Set Category***

2. Create a new category **#Reskin** or Assign it if already created:

3. Edit your game(s) and add a *'Tag'* of the colour you want for your game(s).
- For example, I want a border with the colour **[Crimson](https://www.color-hex.com/color/dc143c)**  ... so I add a **#DC143C** tag:

You can choose any hex color from the site **[Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com)**

## How do I get the box above the game title when a game is selected?
This is based on the **'Source'** field, if you want to show 'Steam', 'Ubisoft' or 'Yuzu' as in the above screenshot, you will need to set these sources in the source field of your game(s).


## Can you add support for any extensions or add-ons?
No as I don't use any extensions (apart from Extra Metadata Loader), plugins or add-ons. However, you can always mod the theme if you prefer.


## I want to show game logos in the Game Details view
You can either add game logos as an icon or you can use Extra Metadata Loader addon **[here](https://playnite.link/forum/thread-814.html)**


## I want to request a feature or report a bug
