```

## I don't see an icon that I want?
You have two options:

1. You can create an icon and place it in ***\Icons\Filters*** in the theme folder
- However you will need to backup your icons as every time the theme is updated it will overwrite the icons in that folder

2. You can raise a request for a new icon/platform/logo **[here](https://github.com/TheKersalMassive/ReskinPS5/issues)**
- Create a **New Issue** and/or attach your icon if you want it added to the theme. Each icon submission will be reviewed and needs to match the general scheme and aesthtic of the theme


## How do I get a green or blue border?
There are currently 3 border colours supported as in the above screenshot
You will need to assign the game to a category below depending on the colour scheme you want.

For example:
- Default PS5 Color: **None**
- XBOX Green: **XBOX**
- Nintendo Switch Aqua: **Nintendo**

For example: If you want a green border for your XBOX games, you need to add the game to the category **XBOX**


## How do I assign a category?
In desktop mode, right click on your game(s) and click on ***Set Category***


## How do I get the box above the game title when a game is selected?
This is based on the 'Source' field, if you want to show 'Steam', 'Ubisoft' or 'Yuzu' as in the above screenshot, you will need to set these sources in the source field of your game(s).


## Can you add support for any extensions or add-ons?
No as I don't use any extensions, plugins or add-ons. However, you can always mod the theme if you prefer.


## I don't want to lose my icons
Logos are only supported via the icons media, sorry.


## I want to request a feature or report a bug
